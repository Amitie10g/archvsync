Archvsync
=========

This is the centralized archvsync configuration. It is a simple git
repository that is currently hosted on ftp-master.debian.org AKA ries.


Use the following conventions in here:

 - As much as possible should be in the master branch (and as such
   affect every machine).

 - Use machine specific branches for those things that *have* to be
   machine specific. Examples for such cases are the
   .ssh/authorized_keys files as well as the actual list of hosts to
   push to / mirror from.
